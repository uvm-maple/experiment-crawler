# Crawling for Experiments

1. Create a virtual environment
2. Load the virtual environment
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt`
4. Iterate frequently by running from the top-level of the repository: `python experiment-crawler/src/expcrawler.py`

# Getting started

Launch your VS Code from the command line to ensure that (a) your paths will be correct and (b) that VS Code will treat the repository as a workspace:

```
cd </your/local/path/to/the/repo>
code . 
```

If this does not work because calling `code` from the command line doesn't work (i.e., `which code` does not print anything), then you will need to [enable launch from the command line](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac).
